The space was huge so we got a nice table with plenty of room to enjoy our breakfast and the service was quick!
The food and especially the coffee was some of the best we had the whole trip!
The freddo flat white was so tasty!!! I could have drank 3!
The breakfast biscuit was delicious with the herb and meat going through the biscuit with a perfectly cooked fried egg!
The granola bowl was also great!
I will think about the flat white for a long time!",5,Coco Cream Matcha is quite nice--good for people who want to get into matcha but prefer for it to be very sweet and creamy. I wouldn't recommend it if you want a real matcha. Super cute chic minimal aesthetic. Lots of space. No WiFi but a good place to study or take a break. They also have a wide variety of yummy backed goods including cupcakes and cookies.,5,"I've been here a few times when I'm in the neighborhood for work: the coffee and espresso drinks are always ELITE! Staff members are knowledgeable and friendly. The only reason I dock a star is because last time I visited, I specifically went for the purpose of getting the cheesecake brownie. However, there were so many gnats INSIDE of the bakery case that I couldn't bring myself to do it. I grabbed a cupcake (they are stored elsewhere) and a latter instead, which were great. I didn't dock any additional stars because it's usually pretty clean inside.
The vibes are usually good here. It's a good place to do work and some nights the cafe transitions into a bar with live music! I'll definitely be back.",4,"This was our first time here. It was a little difficult to find, as we were just visiting. The entrance is nice and the seating area is spacious and inviting. The music was relaxing and had a good vibe. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Raul went the extra mile in making our visit satisfying.

My husband ordered the Biscuit Sammie. They were out of the daily meat, so he substituted bacon. There was an up charge, but they removed it. He said his biscuit was very good, and the herbs really added to the flavor. I ordered the cheesy short rib grits. They tasted fresh with a little kick. I would order them again.

For dessert we ordered cupcakes (carrot cake and vanilla silk). The carrot cake was really good and moist. The vanilla cupcake was good, just a little dry. I would definitely get the carrot cake again.

Overall, I enjoyed my meal. It was definitely pricey for the serving sizes, but I realize we are in DC.",5,"Really nice service and cute ambiance overall, plenty of seating inside and out! My partner and I both enjoyed our lunches here (he had gotten a sandwich). Next time I'd try something else though, as a lot of the pastries looked good.",4,"I have tried this place 3 times now for 3 different cupcakes. This is a review for the cupcakes only. Nothing else. Baked and Wired is my favorite cupcake spot out of any city I have lived. The Tessita is the best cupcake in the world. A Baked Joint has consistently had dry, stale cupcakes. I knew after the second try, I vowed to only travel to Georgetown but I had a huge craving and didn't want to pay the Uber to travel over. This is the third time now. A completely different flavor each time. Dried out frosting and dry cupcake. I didn't think it possible. At Baked and Wired in Georgetown this js never the case. Always consistent.

Does this establishment get second tier cupcakes or day old cupcakes? I can't figure out why the quality is different. I wouldn't judge the cupcakes on this experience.",1,"The food was very delicious, but the service was probably one of the worst experiences we've had in Washington DC. A group of us went into the restaurant more than an hour and 30 mins before closing. When we got to the cashier, Daniel V., was very pushy about how many of us were together and we said we would pay separately as we were planning to in the first place. When one of us went to order first, he kept saying we are out of this, which is fine. However, he didn't actually tell us what was available. He kept saying ""no"" to every single thing. When it was finally my turn, I was like ""what actually is available?"" And he finally told me. In addition, one of my other friends ordered a pizza and they never called his name. His pizza was just sitting there and he realized this when he went to check. We just felt disrespected and a lot of us have worked in the food industry so we were very confused about the whole thing. In addition, one of us also asked for chai and they said the espresso machine stopped a few hours ago but you don't need espresso for chai.",1.0,"Main door entrance was opened before 7:30 AM and a few of of us walked in and greeted by ""sour faces"" no good morning, nothing.
Technically we are not open until 7:30 AM. The clicked says 7:28 AM..
Okay then if that's the case don't open the door.
So ridiculous",1.0,"Service is terrible. I made a special order more than a week in advance and called so many times to confirm the order and pick up date. I get to the place and they were closed. They had a paper sign saying it closed early. These cupcakes were for a birthday and planned ahead for a reason. don't come here.

Ambiance & Service: This Tatte location is spacious with plenty of seating, but it was packed on a Thursday afternoon. Long line, and while food came out quickly, it was served cold.

Food & Drink:
Iced Matcha with Vanilla: Barely any vanilla flavor--underwhelming.
Halloumi & Sunny-Side Sandwich: Tasty, but needed a sauce for flavor and was served too cold.

TL;DR: Busy spot with fast service, but the food and drinks were just okay--style over substance.",3,"After a nice experience at a different location, we chose to try a different Tatte, one closer and more convenient. Even though this one is not at a historic town, it still has a very clean and minimalist style with friendly staff.

This time we tried the croquet madame and the croissant breakfast sandwich. We left yesterday's location wishing we could also fit these two, as they looked quite delicious. However, this time I have to say that looks were deceiving. Even though both sandwiches looked good, the flavors were just ok. There was nothing wrong with them. They did the job and that was fine.

But the location in Georgetown wowed us with flavors and textures, leaving this experience to be just ok. However, their chocolate butter cookies were to die for!!! Take a few or 10 for the road if you must!
",3,"Tatte Bakery & Café - A Familiar Pastry Haven, with Room for Improvement in Service

As a frequent patron of various Tatte locations across the city, I've come to appreciate the brand's consistency in offering quality fare and beautiful, sunlit interiors. This particular branch benefits from a convenient and accessible location an ideal stop for those in search of a quick caffeine fix or a leisurely bite.

The menu offers what one expects from the Tatte experience: a reliable selection of coffee and tea, light bites including their popular ham and cheese croissant sandwich, and an enticing array of pastries that are, for many (myself included), the true draw. The pastry case elegantly presented and filled with seasonal and signature offerings, remains one of Tatte's enduring strengths.

The ambience here is typical of a bustling urban café: fast-paced, moderately crowded, and dependent on first-come, first-serve seating. Orders are placed and paid for at the counter, and if preparation requires a bit more time, guests are given a table number for table-side service.

Unfortunately, while the culinary and atmospheric elements were largely in line with expectations, my experience with one particular staff member at the pastry counter left much to be desired. While I understand that isolated service lapses can occur, the interaction was discouraging. A simple question seeking a personal recommendation between the Dark Chocolate Mousse and the Coffee Caramel Mousse was met not with hospitality or even neutrality, but with dismissiveness. I was told, flatly, that the employee ""doesn't eat anything here."" While honesty has its place, a more professional or customer-friendly response would have been appreciated perhaps referencing customer favorites or which may have been more diplomatic.

I ultimately opted for the Coffee Caramel Mousse, drawn by its uniqueness compared to the more commonly encountered chocolate variety. When I later inquired about the location of utensils, the response again from the same cashier was limited to a silent, curt gesture across the room. No words. No acknowledgment. While I'm not one to dwell on minor slights, such interaction creates a lingering impression that could undermine an otherwise pleasant visit.

To be clear, this critique reflects a single encounter with a single staff member not a condemnation of the entire team or establishment. However, from a management perspective, this type of feedback is crucial. Even well-regarded institutions benefit from periodic training refreshers and customer service recalibration. Small improvements in engagement and professionalism could elevate the guest experience significantly.

In summary, Tatte continues to deliver on its core strengths: attractive spaces, high-quality pastries, and reliable light fare. The Coffee Caramel Mousse was rich and satisfying, and the setting, while unremarkable, is familiar and functional. Prices remain on the premium side, but for many, the quality justifies the cost. That said, hospitality is a key part of the café experience, and this location would benefit from addressing the service gaps that can erode customer loyalty over time.

With improved service, this visit might easily have merited a four-star rating.",3,"As an out-of-town or it is a little intimidating at times to try new places during the lunch hour. However, Tatte Bakery & Cafe made me feel right at home. Great menus, fresh breads and a barista who knows their stuff!",5,"The Tatte Bakery & Cafe is one of my favorites in the area. It's lovely, filled with customers, plenty of staff to get orders out quickly. The atmosphere is great! As I mentioned, it's loud and busy, but I prefer my cafes that way. May not be for everyone though.

I sat at the bar that overlooks the cashier and pastry section. Tatte has a large selection of baked goods, pastries, and desserts. I love the fresh fruit based options.

This recent trip, I ordered a hearty breakfast. The ""Egg in a Hole"" -- Two fried eggs nestled in a housemade sesame Jerusalem bagel. Served with chopped vegetable salad. 680 cal. The Jerusalem bagel is my new favorite. It was covered in sesame seeds and had a firm exterior and soft interior. It was toasted and served with a really good chopped salad on top. I added ham to it and it brought together the whole thing!

I paired my breakfast with a house latte! The oat milk was foamy and it was served hot and fresh from the espresso bar.

Overall loved my experience here. The staff was friendly and prompt to serve me. Will be back soon!",5,"I am extremely displeased with the service I received by way of an employee named Victoria. She presented herself so polite, but as soon as she was asked to perform a task outside of her comfort zone, she became condescending and sarcastic. I patronize quite a few tatte locations, but this is the first time I encountered someone so rude and non accommodating.
When you deal with the public while representing a company, you have to be more poised than that.
I won't be patronizing this location while individuals like this are working there.",1,"Terrible food and service. Overpriced and the food tasted like blood. Support local business

There is outdoor sitting but on a rainy day it didn't help. But on a hot humid day I wonder if people still sit outside.",4,"In DC for a week and found this gem near the Capitol Buildong. Great menu - awesome service with a social cause mindset by supplying coffee for this who are unhoused.

Good menu of Corrtado, Traditional Cappuccino, and Flat White. Highly recommend.",5,"Very cute little shop. Coffee is great. They have a good selection. Service is fast and friendly.
Not much seating but still worth a visit.",5,"Haven't been in a while as I felt it was a bit inconsistent in quality in the past but this time my drink was perfect probably because there were girlies behind the bar. A gripe is I wished the shop allowed me to order an iced cortato or flat white but instead I have to order as a latte with less milk, so it's an expensive drink, but I guess that's the norm here in DC. Either way I still recommend y'all Capitol Hill crowd to please skip Starbucks and support this local shop instead. I promise it'll be a much better drink.",4,"Never really ate here before but the cafe service is solid. Quiet, corner cafe near Union Station! I've enjoyed their Matcha Latte with honey and lavender, iced or hot.

Today, due to a minor hiccup, I enjoyed a beautifully made cafe latte with hazelnut. No regrets!",5,"The staff seemed more annoyed that I interrupted their conversation. From attitude to body language, it was one of the less pleasant interactions I've had.

Otherwise they're pretty quiet.

You can get a better cup of coffee and service ANYWHERE in DC.
Honestly this place deserves 0 stars.
",1,"ADD MORE TABLES, PLEASE! What is it about DC coffeehouses having only 5 tables and an absurd amount of open space? Do you not want people to meet at your establishment to drink your coffee? Do you want to make your establishment as uninviting as possible as hoards of people mill about waiting to pounce on one of the 3 tables? This place was no exception. Coffee drinks looked great and inside was cute but there were literally 5 tables (all full) and tons of people standing over them waiting for tables, so we had to leave. The lower level was closed. Look forward to trying it again if they add more indoor seating on the main level! Don't come here if you're wanting to sit at a table and drink coffee - apparently that's too much to ask! We took our business to Sidamo, as did another group behind us at Ebenezers.",1.0,Terrible coffee. While the coffee shop is cute. The coffee tasted like water. I ordered a cinnamon latte and it tasted like cinnamon water. It was not worth the $8. Very disappointing.,1.0,"NOT PET FRIENDLY

Their Google business listing says they are pet friendly so I walked a long way to have breakfast here. I'm autistic and have a service dog but I still prefer places that are pet friendly so I don't have to discuss my disability with strangers. I came in this morning with my service dog and no one seemed to have an issue with her while I ordered, paid, or waited at a table for my food. But as soon as I went to take my first bite, a woman bent over the counter and started yelling at me that dogs aren't allowed. Not wanting to make a scene, I quickly began to pack up my food to leave. She then came around the counter to rush me and explained that only service dogs are allowed. I explained that that their Google business listing says they are pet friendly AND that she actually is a service dog with a Service Animal ID but she rushed me out anyway. Now I'm literally eating a burrito in the rain and desperately trying to reset my nervous system. Horrible experience to have before I've even had my coffee. Needless to say, I won't be back.",1.0,"I have been coming to Ebenezers since the very first week they opened. I have strong opinions about the place and it all starts with their weak, bitter coffee. I have begun this draft, then put it down because I do not take any joy in a one star review. This is not a take down review like Pete Wells' NYT review of Guy Fieri's Time Square restaurant (best review ever!!!!), however, I write this with a similar frustration expressed there.

The positive: the interior is nice and has been updated recently. The prices are reasonable.

The negatives:
1) Even though I am local to the neighborhood I only come here if I run out of coffee at home or if another place is out. Why? With the exception of some of the cashiers, the staff seems anywhere from aloof to down right passive aggressive. It is not just me, too many of my neighbors and colleagues have noticed this as well. How hard is it to be professionally pleasant and fill a basic drip coffee order (no additions or complicated latte drinks). I feel like a stranger in this shop so I just avoid it for the most part. But for the day light savings time fueled need for caffeine this morning...should have went to 7-11 or anywhere else. I usually walk right past Ebenezers and go to Union Kitchen or Sidamo if the weather is nice.

2) With all that passive aggressiveness one would think the coffee would be something to write home about. It is not. It is, however, something to write a review on Yelp about. The coffee is middling at best and often (the darker roasts) bitter and not in a good way. It always taste like someone rushed to make the pot and did not bother to measure the coffee grounds. Those same grounds taste like they were stored improperly and a tad bit old. You know, like the gourmet bags of coffee beans on display in the checkout line at TJ Max (the $14 bag of Hawaiian Gold coffee now marked down to the TJ Max price of $4.99 is very tempting...just avoid it, you will be disappointed). Perhaps the brew strength is wrong or it was left heating too long. If you have ever had McDonald's coffee around lunchtime after it sat on a burner all morning then you have had a reasonable facsimile of what the coffee taste like at Ebenezers. The brackish dark water that passed for coffee this morning just made me $2 and change poorer and very sad.

3)The space is so cozy and inviting that it has become a de facto telework center, Millennial ""shoe string budget"" business meeting place, and Georgetown law student's personal study nook. Any of those activities are fine in moderation. The issue comes in when those same inconsiderate people occupy the few tables and seats (often chairs are just the person's personal locker strewn with their coats, bags, and books) with for hours on end. Actually, the real issue is that staff should recognize these ""urban settlers"" and move them along in a professional way.

4) The shop is owned and run by a church that bought the property and now sells ""Coffee with a cause."" No issue with that. Heck, I wish my church was as industrious and brought the property when it was just an abandoned shell well over a decade ago. The fact that all profits go towards their community outreach efforts is among the reasons I respect the concept of what they are trying to do. My issue is that they seem to hide behind an ethos tantamount to ""we are a Church first so our service and coffee can suck."" You would think that because they are a church they would want the coffee to be divine! You would think that a church would go out of their way to ensure all patrons felt at home. I am in the neighborhood everyday (I drink coffee or tea every day) same for close to two decades and I intentionally pass this place because it feels like I do not belong.

5) Food choices are provided by many local vendors like Mission Muffins. The food is good, the selection is not. It is so darn hard to get a bagel or simple toast with jam in this neighborhood. The breakfast choices are too complicated and ingredient filled. Maybe this gripe is probably just me because if their business model and subsequent profits are where they want them, that speaks to demand. The area is no longer working class and the menu reflects that.

One well earned star for social activism and other 0.45 for the food (rounded down to one). I am in the minority in that regard, but that is the point. Would that ALL people were made to feel truly welcomed here and the coffee was above middling. It is a shame that this shop, which has been such a source of good in the community, is also the source of some bad feelings and coffee that brings down the mean deviation of otherwise high quality, great coffee in the area. Try it for yourself, maybe your opinion will differ.",1.0,0

I got the plain, chocolate, and pistachio croissants, kouign-amann, and iced ginger-date oat milk latte. The pastries tasted good. They had good flakiness and were buttery. My drink had strong ginger taste than date. It was not bad.

The bakery gets crowded and busy fast. I would come back here again.",4,"We came here for a late lunch on our last day in DC, and it was one of the more memorable meals in the city. The best item, by far, was the preserved fig lemon mint soda. It was so good, we went back for a second drink. Refreshing and super flavorful!

For food, they were sold out of the turkey avocado, so we ordered the chicken pita and the leek / potato / spinach quiche. I've never had a quiche quite like this before...it was full of veggies and had minimal egg, but it was really enjoyable. The chicken pita was really great too, and I'm glad we tried it.

The low points were the black sesame latte -- too minimal on the black sesame flavor. And the desserts we tried -- pistachio cherry tart and a passion fruit krembo -- were dry and just not impressive, respectively.

However, the menu is vast, reasonably priced for DC, and they have multiple locations, so I'd definitely come back.",4,"Love their Ginger Date Oatmilk Latte hot and their crumbs cheesecake.
Hippy ambience near Georgetown university. Service is quick
Tried tomato basil soup - little salty for me and not creamy. I wouldn't order it again.",3,"This was a poppin lunch spot! Parking is impossible, but that's everywhere in DC so I'm assuming you're walking. Their breakfast and lunch rushes are crazy. That said, other than the volume and not finding a place to sit quickly, it doesn't affect much. The service is VERY fast and friendly. I had the Turkey BLAT (bacon, lettuce, avocado and tomato). It has an awesome siracha mayo on it! Not spicy at all but packs a ton of flavor. Mine was heavy in the onions but not a big deal. The coffee (iced mocha with oatmilk) was perfect. I wouldn't come with a big group expecting to be happy, but for a 1-2 table/bar spot or coffee and a bite on the go it doesn't get much better.",4,"Ordered the honey lava latte which was very tasty. For breakfast, I had the breakfast plate which came with eggs, bacon some tomato relish and hash brown potatoes. The Parmesan cheese on top of the potatoes made it pretty salty and the bacon was not crispy and equally salty but otherwise it was a pretty decent breakfast find",4,"I have been almost a regular at Tatte and pick something up every morning before I start my work day. This will probably be the last time I give this location my business. The cashiers get the orders wrong. I am not sure if they are hard of hearing or do not pay attention to what the customer is ordering but it has been consistently wrong. I asked for an avocado sandwich and a smoked salmon and they put our order in as a sausage sandwich 2x. Then my partner went to go get it corrected after looking at the receipt and it was still the wrong order- they still gave us a sausage sandwich. The salmon sandwich was then put in as a smoked salmon.

I brought the attention to who I am assuming is the GM or manager and I told him my order was wrong and he said his employee said that we ordered a sausage sandwich, to which I then corrected him and let him know that my order was incorrect.

He took my food back and waiting for my CORRECT food to come out is taking more than 10 minutes. There was no apology. There should be no reason why I am waiting over 10 minutes for a correction on a mistake that the front of house made. The food should have been made on the fly.

Too much error for such a high price point for food.

Music and lighting is good tho.

Not a happy customer",1,"I was planning to drink some coffee and eat cookies while working on a project till 8pm and since this is located not that far from where I live, I just preferred going to Tatte-- amazing pastry, excellent interior design, and beautifully dressed customers. I love Tatte as a brand but the customer service at this particular location in 250 Massachusetts Ave Washington, DC 20001 is not the best. So let me share my unfortunate experience on July 22nd:

A person cut in line while I was waiting in line to order a pastry and a cup of coffee and I kindly informed the customer thinking that maybe she did not notice that I was in the line, but she did not care. The staff member was extremely rude to me without listening at all and I raised concern saying that ""ma'm I was in line first and she cut in the line"" and the employee told me that I was already mean to customers and now rude to herself, therefore I had two options either pay for it buy the pastry and leave OR leave without purchasing anything. Either way, I could not stay at the coffee shop, she added.

At that moment I was shocked because Tatte was my favorite spot in this area (seriously) and being treated this way was something I had hard time believing. I still kept my cool and requested to share my experience with the manager; however, employee happened to be the manager herself. Then, she refused to tell me her name and told me that I had to leave (over and over again.) She stopped talking to me and ignored me. Literally, she turned back and continued doing her tasks. I was confused because she didn't even give me a heads up that she was going to ignore me. So, in a super confused mode, I did not want any trouble, so I decided to leave the shop. On my way to the exit, I asked one of the crew members what is her name and thankfully they told me that her name was ""Quida.""

Honestly, I even have the Tatte's punch-in-cards and I often stop by this spot. I thought what an amazing place this was till today. I genuinely used to love this beautiful coffee shop, but this treatment was shocking-- what all of this was for? Kindly informing that a customer was cutting in line. If I only stayed silent for an injustice everything was going to be fine and the person was continuing to cutting in lines in other places. This may not be a big deal for some but it certainly is for me. If I am waiting in line, other people should too. And the worst part is that she was rewarded for her actions. This is not cool Tatte.",1.0,"Writing for a friend who wants to remain anonymous, but important to share.

It's a small yet focused menu with attention on seasonal ingredients for your best drinking experience. My friend Kaya pointed out that they are sold out of matcha, which is a bummer because she has declared this the best matcha in the city, but I think it's a great sign to the integrity of a cafe to decide not to put matcha on their menus during a matcha shortage. Rather than feeding into the large market that is hungry for matcha, there could be issues of the quality and purity of the matcha we see today. And if you are going to commit to serving matcha, it must be handled with responsibility, cultural context, and care! To pivot and expand customer palettes I think the Little Hat Cafe's choice of Hojicha ( a roasted version that typically includes more parts of the tea leaf) is a suitable and responsive way to approach what's happening in the beverage industry. Their employees were super busy because this is a popular cafe, but they were all nice and accommodating. Our cashier took the time to explain the latte and how to adjust the sweetness to suit our tasting palettes. The drink itself came out beautifully frothy and fully incorporated. This is essential for all drinks where it's one part high quality ingredient and other parts technique! Technique is tasted in the way the ingredients coat your tongue and genuinely adds to the drinking experience. This attention to detail is very important for shops today as there has been an overall rise in the price of beverages. Craft is everything now. The cafe's design is also just so adorable, I love how simple and fun it is. I'm a big fan of human inspired logos, and it feels fun and a brightening start of your day if you're getting a treat like this. Wonderful job! I'm so impressed.",5,"Finally got to try little hat! They have unique drinks available along with the standard coffee and tea options. I wanted to try a seasonal special so I went with the orange blossom latte. It was more on the floral side and didn't have much of the orange flavor I was expecting, but it was still good and sweet! My friend tried their hojicha and added date caramel syrup and loved it. The employees were very friendly and our drinks were made quickly. It's located inside streets market which is convenient for grocery shopping and picking up a little sweet treat on the way out.",4,"My cafe served pandan syrup earlier this year and it became a hyperfixation for me up until we sold out. I've been missing it ever since and can say this latte scratched that itch. Still think ours had a bit of a bolder flavor and remained a deep green color, but still delicious and one of my favorite coffees I've had in the DMV area thus far. Baristas were nice and helped me get to my preferred sweetness which I appreciated. Also- keep in mind this is a cafe inside a grocery store. So only bar seating, more of a to-go situation, but I think it's worth the trip.",4,"Voted best matcha in DC for a reason! I could drink the matcha yuzu lemonade everyday. It's sweet, tart and well balanced. Only wish their drinks were a bit cheaper. That being said, their cups are on the larger size and all of their drinks are hand made, so def worth checking out if you want a good beverage!
",5,This cute coffee shop is located inside Streets Market. I have been here multiple times and love the vanilla matcha and vanilla latte but everything is great here. The syrups they have are sweet but not overpoweringly sweet. The service is also 5 stars! Love this place!,5,"I came here to meet a friend for coffee and i dont think ill come back. This is probably the worse Chai latte I've had in the city, unfortunately. This place is likely good if you're on the go because it's very conveniently located right on 14th street. Inside there are only seats. You're expected to sit outside which is lovely in the summer, but not so much any other time of year. The service was quick and friendly.",2,,,,,,,,,0

I ordered a delicious, flaky, and savory tomato topped-pastry and an almond croissant. I paired my tomato topped pastry with a cappuccino. I will say that this bakery specializes in their perfectly made croissants and pastries and not their coffee. The cappuccino was made quickly and thrown together because of the long lines. That's okay! I just won't return or recommend their coffee.

Ordered a caffé macchiato and madeleine as a light snack while on a Saturday walk. The macchiato was lovely, and the madeleine was decent, though admittedly a bit dry. Both were reasonably priced for downtown DC, especially for a small business competing with chains. The staff was friendly and helpful as well; some of them even had lovely French accents which completed the aesthetic.

We got there around noon and there was a long line but it did move fast. The place itself is not the large so maybe not the best idea trying to sit and eat there.

It is located in a great spot near the metro and we stumbled upon it on our way to our hotel. The staff was very kind and polite and the ambiance is quiet and quaint which we loved after a busy day. The desserts look phenomenal and taste just as so! I delighted in the cream puff which was creamy and crispy and decorated with some sugar on top. There is also coffees on the menu and a little indoor and outdoor sitting area but we did not get any drinks. Overall a must for a sweet dessert!,5,"Overhyped and overpriced. Croissants were very dense, dry and incredibly overcooked. When we brought this to the attention of a staff member she apathetically replied ""oh no..."" and offered absolutely no solution. Would not come back here for any pastry. Poorly made pastries matched by equally poor service.",1,"What a huge fall from grace. My once wonderful neighborhood bakery has become such a disappointment. I have rarely been able to get anything I was going in for in months. I saw they were adding a sandwich to the menu and was delighted as they only have sweets.

Moving next to a Canele that better resembled a Gum Drop, the interior actually wet without much of a sponge and the shell lacking any semblance of crunch, things got only slightly better with a Madeline that was over-baked brown, the Financier similarly tanned but holding up better thanks to Almond Flour and more Sugar while the Croissant Bread Pudding could have been good were it served warm instead of refrigerator cold as the Custard helped mellow the Frangipane.",1.0,Rude service， calling guests by wrong name and feeling super reasonable.

I got a box of goodies - everything was good and the Ube and Pandan donuts and Thai Curry Tart were the highlights!

The fluffy donuts taste like beignets with cinnamon sugar coating, the Pandan has a sweet coconutty flavor while the Ube tastes like a subtle vanilla custard. The Black Sesame donut had an interesting flavor and reminded me of an everything bagel.

The Ube Cheese Kouign Aman was flavorful and decadent.

The Thai Curry Tart was bursting with flavor and the savory Garlic Scallion Bun was soft and fluffy.

The ambiance is really nice and the service was just as sweet as the goodies. Excited to come back!",5,"I have really been loving Rose Ave recently - I feel like since they cut back their hours, they've really upped their game. Rose Ave is a bakery that fuses French and Asian pastries: everything from black sesame donuts to crab Rangoon kouign amann to gochujang cornbread. Their donuts are really a standout for me here - the passionfruit one in particular is well worth a trip to try! When I first tried them 2 years ago, I found them a bit inconsistent (especially their laminated pastries), but recently I've been really impressed by the quality of their baking. The ube kouign amann, scallion bun, and pandan donut were all fantastic when I ordered them this past month. I also had to try their seasonal corn foam on their ube iced coffee, and it was absolutely delicious - a very strong corn flavor that paired perfectly with the ube. They have a very creative drink menu that often has weekend or seasonal specials, and I especially like their tea-based drinks! Four stars to reflect all of my experiences over the years, but this month it's been a solid 5 stars across the board!

If you haven't been to Rose Ave before, or if you've had similar experiences to me in the past, I definitely think they're worth the trip! They've been consistently delicious and have kept me coming back regularly lately. Staff are also always very welcoming in my experience, and they have special items every weekend.

I've been fortunate enough to come at off hours when there is seating available. However, this place is always hustling, so - especially on the weekends - be prepared to wait a little bit in line and possibly have to take your pastries to go. I feel very fortunate to live so close to this lovely bakery!",4,"A very nice café and bakery. All the bakery goods are made on site and they use a very good grade of coffee for cappuccino.

I've been talking to them and see if they can extend their bakery line to include some low sugar content items. Other than that, it's wonderful.",5,"Rose Ave Bakery in Woodley Park is a pan-Asian inspired bakery and coffee shop serving great specialty lattes and delectable pastries. We enjoyed the ube and Saigon banana latte. The ube iced coffee was reminiscent of a Vietnamese coffee with a sweet ube kick, while the banana latte was perfectly balanced and tasted exactly like banana. For a pastry we sampled the garlic scallion bun that combined strong garlic flavor with a gorgeously flaky texture. Dreaming of coming back here the next time we are in DC",5,"Rose Ave Bakery seems like it might be busy until it runs out. The line was that long, and the food was that good. I didn't love that people had to cut through the line to get to tables, but in such a tiny space there wasn't much to be done about that. I chose the mango sticky rice tart, which was great, my daughter had a donut, I can't remember which kind, but she loved it, and the two of us split a savory butternut squash pastry, which was yummy. I had an iced coffee which was good, but the reason to come here is for the pastries.",4,"Came here for a business conversation and was shocked to find exceptionally limited seating. There was barely room for a couple of pairs to sit down and talk to each other and outlets are not very conveniently located next to each spot. I was also shocked by how dirty the floor was; there were dust bunnies flying around in each of the corners. I do appreciate the free internet.

The drink availability was also a shock. They only have coconut and soy milk as alternatives and when I asked for my matcha to be made with an alternative, they informed me that their matcha drinks are pre-mixed with regular milk. That is a telltale sign of poor quality.

While their pastries look delectable, I am unlikely to return here for anything but those.",1,"Over priced cafe which has Asain pastry.
Very disappointed. I personally don't recommend this place to anyone!",1.0,"Went there for the first time recently; I did a pre-order online. Had no idea there were 2 separate lines (one for pre-order & other was for walk-in orders)

The pre-order line was way slower than the walk-in line. Was not at all impressed with service. The pineapple bun with pineapple butter was hard as a brick.
My sister came from GA & wasn't impressed with overall service & taste of the 3 donuts & pineapple bun. Also, there was 3 little cups. I have no idea if it was extra sugar for the donuts. Because they were empty. We both agreed that Krispy Kreme makes better donuts.

- Iced kopi susu (4/5): Nice and creamy and not overly sweet! My gf is a bit picky with her coffee and didn't like the blend they used but once it was mixed well she was happy with it.

Overall (5/5): We visited here back in late September. Really fast service and decent price for the coffee. Probably wouldn't work/study here though as it's a bit small and pretty busy + noisy but it could be a nice place to have a quick catch up with friends or pop in for a quick break.

I ordered a hot Kopu Susu latte and he said it was one of their best sellers. I waited a few minutes for my drink and it was called out when ready at the counter.

It was pretty busy and every table was taken both inside and out. We settled on the bench along the wall (inside) and it turned our to be pretty comfy.

First off I ordered a brown latte and it was very gross and thick. The first quarter of the coffee was mostly foam and the rest of it was thick similar to a heavy hot chocolate and just a very bad taste! I ended up throwing it out and stop in a pastry shop to get water just to get the foul taste out of my mouth!
I also got a slice of their lemon pound cake and was also very disappointed. The cake was very dry and at first has not flavor then you taste fake lemon (gross!).

So I want this owner to do this experiment himself --- You found a seat in front window seat in a very busy and crowded afternoon with 10 plus people blocking the pathway waiting to order stuff. You bought coffee and a sticky chocolate brownie kind stuff and you need a napkin since you are not a person eating with hands.. So to get that 'precious' napkin, you need to say 3 times of excuse me to squeeze yourself to walk through the 10 people waiting crowd and walk through the long path to get it from that table and repeat the same thing back to your window seat. As a owner you should know the unique shape of your shop including the separation of window seats and back seats, as well as the long path connecting them. If your condiment table and all the seats are allocated close together then you are right. But that's not the case for your shop, and your waiting line and group also completely block the path for window seats customers to move. As a owner you should see and think such common things with common sense. While you told me what you said, why didn't you think what you can do better ? Why don't you just put some napkins in the window seats area ? You should go to other cafes and see how they handle it, rather than just tell me ""this is how we do it.""",1.0,"Dua... do NOT!

Perfect for a World Cup Saturday where you may want to start your morning with caffeine and end your morning with a beer.

There's a large outdoor space to enjoy your drinks as well as a smaller indoor space. There's also a food truck that I would for sure try at some point.

We had the iced matcha and iced maple latte because iced coffee/tea is perfect in any season. The iced matcha was pretty good- if I'm in the area and am in a tea mood I'd definitely go back. What I loved more though was the iced maple latte. It had the great balance of sweetness that can be hard to find sometimes.

So whether you enjoy a beer, coffee or both this is a cool spot",5,"Day or night, Aslin packs a lot of fun. It's a great use of space in a spot that was formerly vacant, and the fact that it used to be a gas station adds some visual interest too! And of course the colorful mural of Justice Jackson plus the first Black judge. Folks may not recognize the other woman on the mural, Constance Baker Motley, the first Black woman who served as a federal judge.

On to the coffee and beer! In the morning early/afternoon, I tried out the $16.00 Wednesday unlimited coffee deal and I was VERY caffeinated! I tried the black sesame snickerdoodle latte, matcha, chai, and Cafe Morena (all iced because it is hot out here.. whew!). I think my favorite was the Cafe Morena (americano and dulce de leche) because it's similar to Vietnamese iced coffee. I enjoyed the variety! If you can brave the heat this summer, it's a great place to work for at least a couple hours. (Note: Not many outlets!).

Having the Bun'd Up truck there is great and convenient for a bite. My favorite is the miso chicken bao. I wasn't a huge fan of the mushroom one (sorry, vegetarians!).

Now pack up your laptop and stick around to get a refreshing beer. At night, it's a bustling beer garden. (Technically you can start drinking at noon. No one is judging.) Sometimes I'm not a big IPA fan, but I liked the purple starfish and double orange starfish IPA plenty.

It was a small annoyance because coconut is not a nut, necessary, but they were too annoyed to give us a refund or further explanation. Other times staff is short, clearly stressed, or passive aggressive (which upon reading the other reviews & talking to friends has been common here).

I also spontaneously ordered the mish mish soda (apricot and honey) which was just the right amount of fruity sweetness to be refreshing.

I was visiting a couple cafes that day so wanted to pace myself but I'll definitely be back for their pitas and more tots!

It's perfect for a quick grab-and-go meal you can enjoy by the Georgetown waterfront, or you can dine in--the indoor space has a really cool, vibrant atmosphere.

I always get the chicken shawarma, and recently tried the hot harissa version. Personally, I prefer the regular chicken shawarma, but both are solid. I've also had the tots with dipping sauce--so good--and the hummus is a must-try.

The one downside is the line, which can get pretty long, but honestly, it's worth the wait. The food is on the pricier side (about $18 for a pita), but the portions are generous, so you're definitely getting your money's worth.",5,"I was in the area and I heard so much good things about this place, so I had to give it a go. I ordered my shwarma through my phone and went to pick it up around 20 minutes after I placed my order. The walk in line was super superrrrr long so I def recommend either to make reservations or to order ahead.

- Harissa honey chicken shwarma; 9.6/10 (great bread texture and tasty chicken. Kinda wished the sauce was distributed inside the bread evenly though.. the top was a bit dry without the green sauce)

Because I waited a while, I got many different items to try, including the chicken shawarma, baklava croissant, iced latte, potato tots and my cousin also got the hummus pitta to share.

Service stinks - the servers think you are there to please them - because ""they are so busy"". I asked for a glass for my beer and no one came back. Instead, when I went up to the counter to get my own glass. I was directed to the plastic cups at the water station.

The environment had far too many people for the store not to have someone working to control the crowds. The food was meh I have had far better falafel pitas in Virginia.

So rude and horrible service. Had to go and sit on the street and eat before the sandwich got cold. Will never be back.",1.0,"First of all, I want to say I had a bad experience here, and when I tried to complain to the team--the chef, the coffee director (¿?), the executive pastry chef, and the general manager--they all blocked me.

We went to Yellow on Thursday, May 15th, and we didn't have a reservation.
We signed up for the list (the guy who served us at the time told us we'd have to wait an hour, or even an hour and a half), so we thought we'd wait while we strolled through Georgetown. We gave them our phone number so they could let us know.
We checked our phones a couple of times for messages, but there where none.
We came back after about 50 minutes, as the guy had told us we'd have to wait between an hour and an hour and a half. When we arrived, the person I assume is the manager told us they'd sent a message after 30 minutes (from then on, it wasn't an hour or an hour and a half), and we checked our phones and there was nothing.
The manager showed us that she had sent the messages, and yes (I don't know if it was my number, but she had some messages in her system), but I also showed her that we had nothing.
Nothing in iMessages, nothing on WhatsApp, nothing on an iPhone, and nothing on an Android.
We told her we could wait a little longer but wished she could give us priority, and she told us rather rudely that no, the only thing we could do was order at the register and go to the tables outside (It had just rained).
We told her again that, in addition to not having any messages, we had been told the wait could be up to an hour and a half, and since we had nothing, we had returned after 50 minutes. She asked if she could please try to do something for us. She told us again that she couldn't do anything, that it was either order at the register or leave (and she left at that moment. We even think she went upstairs through an outside door. We don't know if she lives there or if there's an office, but she left us standing there). It's worth noting that there were two tables reserved for two people, one of which took 25 minutes to occupy.
Since we were already starving, we decided to eat that way, paying at the register and at the tables outside, but the experience was already ruined.

And look, the food? It was very good. We really liked everything we ate (the food is VERY good as in VERY good fast food and YES IT´S PIZZA). But the service experience, in relation to what had happened, had already given us a very bad time.

We are art professionals (that´s why we went to DC), we work with international teams from the USA and Europe, and I say this because we've never had any problems receiving any kind of iMessages, notification, or WhatsApp on our phones, and we didn't have any messages from the restaurant.

I can't say they didn't send us the message, but what I can say with certainty is that we didn't receive anything, and that the person in charge didn't have the empathy to do anything for us, even if it meant waiting a little longer.

ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT THING:
I contacted @chefmichaelrafidi and the bakery and coffee managers, in addition to filing a complaint on the Yellow Instagram page, and ALL of them blocked me. I imagine it's customary at the chef's restaurants? Blocking complaints about poor service at their restaurants? This was doubly bad because my approaches to them were kind and considerate, letting them know only about the poor treatment, lack of conscience, and lack of consideration from the manager on duty (who literally left us standing there and walked away).

I had an absolutely decadent ham and cheese croissant from Pluma, and it was far better than I expected. In fact, it very well might have been the best one I've had since a trip to much lauded Tartine Bakery in San Francisco.

What made this so damn good? Crispy layers of croissant, unimpeded buttery goodness, a super high quality ham, and what I suspect was a bubbly gruyere. This combination of ingredients might seem simple, but the Pluma folks have mastered it on all fronts.

This was definitely one of the food highlights from a recent trip to my old home in Washington DC. I hope to make acquaintance with this bakery again in my near future.",5,"My friend and I stopped by Pluma before we grabbed dinner in the Union Market area last Saturday afternoon! The interior is minimal and spacious. The seating is mainly a long and wide table (good for co-working) that can fit 10+ people. It is a bit cold in there, but other than that, it was a nice spot to chill at for a couple hours.

COLD BREW - 5.50
I don't remember the cold brew much, so it was probably average. It went well with the pastry I got, though.

CHOCOLATE PISTACHIO CROISSANT - 6.75
This is one of their most popular pastries. The chocolate croissant was dusted with a layer of confetti sugar, and it contained a lightly whipped pistachio cream that wasn't too sweet. Overall, a more unique croissant, but if you're health conscious, I'm not sure if I'd recommend.

Pluma is on the pricier side, but they're on the inKind app! So if you have inKind, the amount you end up paying is more reasonable.",4,"The service was amazing. Everyone was very kind and joyful.

The coffee (standard oat milk latte) was good, and the baked goods were fantastic. I had the chocolate croissant and the ham and cheese croissant. The pastry was flaky, tender, moist, and had good flavor. The ham and cheese was really great, too. I would have liked a bit more chocolate in the chocolate croissant, but otherwise really nice.

I will absolutely be back!",5,"While there's pastry and baked goods galore, the Almond Croissant hit the spot! The croissant had a crispy shell with sweet frangipane almond custard cream. Excited to come back for more croissants!
",5,"I've had Pluma croissants at work plenty of times and they are buttery flaky little pillows of deliciousness. Today I stopped in with a friend who loves bakeries and here's what I thought.

- seems like a good spot to get work done if you work from home. It smells delicious in here and there's a long table with lots of space. A couple people were on their laptop so I'm assuming there's free WiFi.

- service was fine, the associate was helpful and efficient.

- you MUST try to this apple croissant pastry with caramel on it. It was a great pairing of sweet and salty. It was $6

- not too big of a fan of their chai, I'd go somewhere else

Also do not come here for WiFi- it does not work.",1.0,"This place looks nice for sure. But I'm not sure why they went with stumptown as their coffee of choice. There are so many other great local roasters. In dc, stumptown might as well be Starbucks. Even baked joint/ baked and wired provides an alternative espresso and a variety of other roasters for pour overs. The fact that peregrine - which has a Location a stones throw away at union market - now roasts their own small planes brand here in town makes it even more imperative that this place bring something unique. To top it off, blue bottle is opening across the very short, un-traffic'd street. Are there any two other cafes in town this close to one-another? Maybe the plan is to bank on their baked goods and other offerings (if they have any). The service was also mixed.",1.0,"Pluma has exceptional baked goods and other menu items.

Thank you Baked and Wired for always being there for me.",5,"Sunday 6/15/2025

This is a heavily anticipated spot of mine ever since it was added to my list back in early 2023. I had been avoiding driving & parking in DC for takeout spots due to my assumption that it would be hard to do those things, but I'm over that.

I already knew this was a very popular spot due to ratings, reviews, and social media exposure, but you can see it in person with how active and lively it was in there. Now $6.20 is the highest I've ever paid for a cupcake, but if it's worth it, then I have no problem.

I ""broke the bank"" and got 4 different cupcakes all valued at $6.20 each: strawberry, carrot cake, red velvet, and chocolate doom.

- The strawberry cupcake was a very enjoyable experience that ended up being my favorite. The execution of a vanilla base that's mixed with real strawberries made it worthwhile.
- The carrot cupcake was pretty good, and I'd say it was my second favorite item tried.
- The red velvet was alright to me, I ended up getting it cause it was a popular item from the reviews, but it wasn't anything special to me.
- The chocolate doom was a similar experience to the red velvet... it was alright, but nothing special or impressive.

All in all, I do like that all the cupcakes are moist, but they aren't worth the $6.20 price tag. I'd say the spot overall is overrated and overhyped; it's not bad or anything, I just had higher expectations based on the hype. Wouldn't go out of my way to come back, but I'm glad I was able to check it off the list.",3,"I decided to stop by after picking up some thing from my organization. I was in the mood for a cold drink & was recommended to go to Baked & Wired. I will admit that I was a little confused when I entered the building. I wasn't sure if it was a separate entity or the same one. It was kinda split in half. Nevertheless, I went to the side that looked like they served coffee & cold drinks. It was quite tiny. I got the iced matcha & wanted it to be sweet. The baristas were rather quiet but timely with their service.

I felt that my matcha was not sweet enough so I added more sweetner/ simple syrup to it. It did the trick. The other side seemed to have some yummy looking pastries & they also seem to serve drinks. If I am ever in the neighborhood again, I may swing by and try a different drink with a pastry.
",4,"We were in the area to catch a movie and walked by Baked & Wired. There was a line before and after the movie, but it moves fast so we got on the line.

I had a large oat milk latte, which apparently comes with 4 shots. I'm so used to lattes coming with just 1 shot, so I had originally ordered a double. The barista questioned that as she was making the order and they even refunded us because I definitely did not need an 8 shot latte.

I had a raspberry lemon bar, which was really good. The lemon curd was just the right amount of puckery sour. The cupcakes are also really good. My husband had a carrot cake cupcake and I almost think it was better than the lemon bar!",4,"A bit overpriced and overrated. While Baked and Wired has earned some cred in the cupcake wars, it's caused it to be overcrowded, staff seemed a bit rushed and stressed, and seating was very limited. They do have tasty baked goods and creative takes on cupcakes and while we had to wait outside in the heat, the line did move quickly. Good - but not worth the wait or price.",3,"their cupcakes are very sweet. you cannot taste the pistachio, nor the lemon because they are masked by sugar!

Choose a different place",1,"Almost a five, but a few key misses.

You order at the counter, find a seat and they bring the food to your table. You can't customize a meal (e.g even though there's bacon, you can't order just a side of bacon.) Therefore, I had to order a breakfast that came with bacon just to get bacon for my son. Not a big deal, just calling it out.

The workers are all very friendly. Service is fast and nice.

The AC was out while we were here. I don't think that's an always thing, they had fans to keep it bearable in July, but it was on the hot side.

The good: the ginger date oat milk latte which is seasonable was delicious. I regretted getting it hot after realizing the AC was out, but it was still great. I don't like my drinks that sweet so I would ask for it to be a tad less sweet next time.

The just ok: my son loved his bacon, I was meh on my poached eggs and hashed browns. The sourdough bread was good. I just wished I liked my food more.

My other son got a $4 chocolate chip cookie. I thought it was ok, but being that he only ate half and I didn't love it I'd try another pastry next time.

The decor is beautiful and they have water out and readily available.

If you're in the area, I would definitely recommend checking this place out.",4,"My first time to Tatte. In terms of look, feel, tempting choices etc it was all perfect. I ordered just 1 item though, the sausage egg breakfast sandwich. The bread was great but the sausage had minimal taste and a pasty texture. The worst was that they threw a very crunchy half green slice of tomato into the mix which at first i thought was a salsa or something.

Overall my sandwich disappointed with minimal cheese and sausage flavor and a tomato that should not have been used for anything. The best part was the choice between scrambled egg and fried. My lightly fried or over eat egg was luscious and great.

I would totally try Tatte again but my first visit wasn't a winner.",3,"(Edited to add photos) I heard so much about this place and I get it. It wasn't far from my hotel so it was perfect. They have a great all-day menu with breakfast, sandwiches, salads, soups, desserts, etc. It was pretty busy but I got through the line and ordered within 20 minutes. The lamb hash was the EXACT breakfast I needed, perfectly cooked lamb and veggies in comforting & warm spices. The little strawberry raspberry cheesecake was a nice lil sweet treat.

Well the ""jury is out,"" and my opinion is very clear. TCB is amazing. This place has everything it needs to stand out as a local, cozy, and unique experience.

From its location, exterior has spacious seating surrounded by tree's and quiet neighborhood roads. The interior, while a small space utilizes its room just enough to feel quaint and comfortable. As I sit on a couch, head leaning back into the couch - there is enough room for an individual to walk past, behind me, uninterrupted. The interior especially combines that homey experience with the modern with days gone metal decor with new pop of pink lights for those social media posts. Very ambient.

From my experience, many coffee shops don't recommend straight black coffee - yet I sit here with the TCB Cold Brew Concentrate 24 Hour special (with an Option for 36 Hour special too). The roasting process must be rigorous as its flavor profile is so much - rich, bold, decadent, nutty, a Smokey after bit, coursing with caffeine through and through. I'd highly recommend when visiting.

The cashier and the assistant (male and female; names to follow) were very helpful with considerations and opinions on what I should get. In the environment of DC, I wouldn't expect such customer service and care free as my experience has been opposite. Couldn't ask for better service as they took time even with a constant line behind me.

Overall (I'm sorry long review) TCB has no right being this good when I hadn't heard of it before hand. No surprise I heard of this place from a local and as a tourist: couldn't be happier with the experience. I'd highly recommend the TCB for a quick run and go coffee or sit down to appreciate the coziness.

Post Review Edit: Thank you Eliza and Max for their excellent service.",5,"A solid local shop w fab foamed milk and vibes!

I've been going here for about a decade now and love its location and vibes. It's on a corner of a residential neighborhood across from a school in a stereotypical old DC building. Theres's seating on the semi-bay windows, bar and a variety of seating inside, as well as ten small tables outside.

I had a hot vanilla latte this trip paired with zucchini bread. The milk was foamed perfectly per usual and the drink wasn't too sweet. They use ceremony espresso beans, which is a very standard medium roast--not astringent or burnt, and an overall smooth crowd-pleaser. The zucchini bread was tender, moist, and had a great crumb. Perhaps it was the raisins, but overall it was a touch too sweet for me... But I would still eat it again lol! I overheard they get their baked goods from Hawthorne, a local wholesale bakery.

For food, I ordered the cinnamon bun kouign amann and an iced matcha latte with oat milk. Both were really good. The kouign amann had a nice flaky texture with the perfect amount of cinnamon sweetness. The matcha was smooth, not too bitter, and paired well with the pastry.
One thing to note is that this location does not allow laptops on weekends which keeps the space feeling more social and open but may be a downside if you were hoping to get some work done.

",5,"I came to Maman right after landing in D.C., and it was such a lovely first stop. The café itself is beautiful, with a clean and calming atmosphere, and the staff were super friendly and welcoming.
I ordered a matcha latte--it was a bit on the milkier side, but still decent. Nothing too strong, but good enough for a casual drink. It's definitely a nice spot to sit, relax, study, or just recharge for a bit. The vibe is quiet and peaceful, and I'd come back for the ambiance and friendly service alone.",4,"Such a great café! I came for breakfast and loved the cozy vibe and self-seating setup! Love that they serve real cocktails, which is rare in a café. Plenty of self-seating, great atmosphere--I'll definitely be back for the pastries!
I ordered:
- Quiche (Sarah)
- Side Salad
-Grapefruit Rose Martini--so good!",5,"I have never been served a burnt quiche before. My mistake for not looking at my food before I left. Burnt food is unacceptable at any level of the food industry.
",1,"Some friends and I stopped by after our first option for breakfast was no longer an option on a bustling Saturday morning. I will say that I've frequented their sister location near Union market (which is clearly superior) many times before so I was shocked by the service and the quality of food at this location. Clearly, when you first arrive you can tell that the location is busy, however after waiting for 5 minutes at the door we later could see that they were understaffed and clearly in the weeds. After searching for an empty table and finding none in this smaller location we realized that the only option was to slowly encroach on a table which we thought would be leaving soon. To our delight we only had to wait 10 minutes for this to happen. However, after sitting we noticed that no one was cleaning the dirty tables let alone sanitizing them. After waiting minutes for this to happen I took it upon myself to ask one of the wait staff to buss the table (to which he looked very confused) and later had to ask him to actually sanitize the table because apparently this isn't an expectation.

After looking at the menu we settle for the Katie's chicken sandwich and Rose steak sandwich and a few pastries. When my friends food arrived their items looked appealing, however when my food arrived I was disappointed that my Roses sandwich looked like it had the remaining thin trimmings (no more than 3oz and I'm being generous saying that) for the flank steak instead of the actual flank steak. It being luke warm and in dire need of more of the tahini sauce also didn't help. I was also disappointed that their mixed green salad had clearly seen better days that was tossed in some balsamic dressing. The pastries although visually appealing could either used some warmth or they clearly weren't made the same day as I had a difficult time enjoying the seemingly stale kouign amann.",1.0,"Review is for my visit on Thursday 1/11/24.

I see a lot of these locations popping up in DC. The Location is a good place to work remote or for business meetings in the City Center area. But that's just about it. Everything is over priced. A cup of coffee here is more expensive than Starbucks, less tasty and less strong. You will spend close to $8+ for a small to medium cup.

Food is over priced and every item there's an up charge. For example, biscuit is close to $4, but to add jelly that's another $2.50. I could go eat at the Conrad ""Eustary Restaurant""
(across the street) for breakfast, view overlooking city center and pay way less. AND the jelly is free with their crossisants. Coffee is cheaper and service is top notch there.

The Barista here are rude, slow and try to up charge for everything.",1.0,"Ambiance is the only thing that is great there. Went there with my daughter.

Small coffee house vibes inside. Wasn't sure what to order so the baristas offered some tastings of the lattes on tap! It was incredible and helpful in guiding our order.

Ended up with a plain latte and a London fog. That latte was standard but fun to try the fresh version of what they can. The early grey took me back to my favorite college coffee shop. It was pure nostalgia for me and loved every sip. Husband wished it was a warmer day because he would have gotten one of the coffees on tap.",5,Great place to get a cup of coffee and a pastry. The staff were super friendly and helpful. They have non-coffee drinks as well and their seasonal coffee offerings change regularly. It is also kind of in a hidden alley which adds to the appeal!,5,"If you're a fan of a good dirty chai latte, this one is an absolute game-changer. The balance between spicy chai and smooth espresso is spot on, creating the ideal harmony of bold and comforting flavors. The chai is perfectly spiced--not too overwhelming, but just enough to provide that warm, aromatic kick that you crave. If you're a chai or coffee lover (or both!), this is a must-try!",5,"Great coffee
I stopped by to try their seasonal strawberry draft latte. I got two small drinks. One drink was filled to the top but the other one noticeably had less volume. Felt a bit ripped off considering that it is almost $7 per drink.",4,"Big fan of La Colombe and try to visit shops whenever I travel and a city happens to have one or more.

I tried this La Colombe as I was walking around the Blagden Alley area. It's a quaint spot with lots of street art. This La Colombe was lovely!

Great decor inside and out, ample seating, and nice staff.

I had a draft latte and really enjoyed it. Super fresh and great balance of flavor. A nice variety of options for hot + cold drinks and some pastries.",5,"Came in and had to wait for them to finish their conversation so I could order. Everyone was greeted upon walking in, except for me. $7 for foam?? When my drink was ready, I was confused and accidentally grabbed the wrong one. They looked at me as if I was stupid and murdered someone. Unfortunately the only nice person helping customers wasnt here when I ordered/ came in. I wish they were since they are making suggestions and seem approachable.
",1,"So...great coffee, yes. Overpriced, yes. But look at the menu before you go.
People working there hate their job and dont want to deal with you AT ALL. Had questions about the menu and the response by the man standing at the door is: menu is outside. This is while the music is blasting and he is whispering behind his mask.
Rushed thru my coffee and proceeded to another counter to pay.

I get it, covid, but surly communicate with your customers and at least make them feel welcome so they come back. I certainly wont be back!",1.0,"I recently moved to the area and I was asking a fellow resident from my apartment building where I could get good coffee and they told me ""La Colombe has good coffee but the staff is rude"". I thought ""that's weird... maybe the person you met had had a rough day?""

I thought I'd check for myself (I really wanted coffee) and unfortunately was able to corroborate instantly. Yes, the staff was outright rude (the mocha was good I admit).

A month passed and I thought ""I'll give it another try"". Staff was rude once again. This time I left without even getting my coffee. I don't care how good your coffee is. If you foster a workplace culture of treating your customers like garbage, then you don't deserve to be in business. So. that's it for me.

I should add this is the first time ever for me.

Guy can barely remember my order and goes to check. Turns out one of the baristas either forgot or never got the order. Finally, barista gives me my drink.

",5,"Maybe the most pillowy pita I've ever had in my life, but still strong enough to hold up to the excellent shakshuka. My only disappointment is that even the food served in was still served in a disposable to-go container, which feel like more trash than is really needed.

Breakfast egg pita was similarly pillowy, and the tahini chopped salad with red onion was delicious.

Would recommend!",4,"This casual restaurant-slash-upscale café is always buzzing and for good reason. Between the wood-fired pitas, standout pastries, and creative lattes, it's a gem I keep coming back to.

I've worked my way through nearly every pita on the menu and highly recommend the Smoked Amba Chicken or the steak. The only one I didn't love was the lamb shoulder, mostly because the barbecue sauce was a bit heavy for my taste -- but that's a personal preference.

One of the most underrated highlights here is the pastries and coffee. Every single pastry I've tried has been perfect. My top picks are the filled croissant and the olive oil cake -- both spot-on in texture and flavor. Their lattes are also unlike anything else in DC, with unique flavors like Baklava Mocha, Halawa Honey, and even Turmeric (surprisingly delicious!).

Service is casual but consistently friendly. You order at the counter, and they call your name when it's ready. The staff has always been patient when I have questions or need a recommendation.

Prices are a bit high for the casual vibe of the restaurant, but I'm willing to splurge for what feels like great ingredients and food I do not cook at home myself. I would plan to spend about $20-40 per person.

Just a heads-up: it can get loud inside, so it's not ideal for deep conversations. But otherwise, this spot is a monthly go-to for me. 10/10 recommend!
",5,"I adore Yellow!! I used to go to the Georgetown location a lot, but the lines are so brutal and it's so overwhelming in there. I prefer this location just because it's more spacious and less chaotic. I can't even count how many times I've been here and while everything on the menu is fantastic, I'd highly recommend trying the turmeric+honey latte, jammy egg croissant, batata tots, or any of their pitas if it's lunch. I can't even pick a single sweet pastry here because I love them all tbh. So what are you waiting for?? Yalla!!
",5,"Greet immediately on entry and I was able to get a seat even though I didn't have a reservation and it was decently busy inside. Tables are close to each other in some areas and there is a communal table in the center so just expect to be close to other patrons.

I had the mish mish soda which definitely had an interesting flavor and the lamb kefta which was delicious. The pita is an extra cost- which if I'm paying for the kefta I feel like they should give you some pita but it's still quite filling without it.

The waitress was attentive and they check in often.",5,"The line system is nonexistent. No one really knows how to line up because it's not clearly communicated by design. Some line up along the long table; others line from outside. The employee keeps on telling people where to line up, causing people to cut in or lose their place. That was unpleasant, especially when it's raining outside. I strongly suggest having employees stand and direct people to stand where they need to stand. Or, better yet, have an employee take orders among the crowd and give customers order numbers.",1,"I came during the evening hours , and prices were absolutely ridiculous. 40$ for lamb and some rice, and I only got a singular lamb chop for the insane price. On top of that, there was sesame seeds hidden in the rice beneath the mountain of herbs, which I am allergic to. And since they were hidden and it's not listed anywhere on the menu I ended up having a minor allergic reaction",1.0,"If you like waiting in lines that don't move for 30+ minutes and charge bogus 3% ""wellness fees"" this is the spot for you!

The food is unfortunately not good enough to justify a wait longer than 5-10 mins on the busiest day. Staff is disappointingly inefficient at moving customers through the line. Instead, they stand around idly while indecisive people try to place an order instead of taking orders from people who are ready. It's a bummer that staff allows patrons to continuously let multiple people join them in the line. It was frustrating for those of us who keep getting pushed back in line. My party of 3 and two other parties walked away after 35 minutes in a line that never moved forward, only backward. It didn't seem like too many people were coming out either. The space is very small with not enough seating for all the people so presumably we should've seen takeout orders exiting the restaurant.

The pastries were mid. And the hot chocolate was watery and bitter (I am willing to consider that this kind of hot chocolate is an acquired taste, but certainly not for kids.

I was so impressed. The food, itself, was delicious. It was a little bit busy on a Sunday morning, but we were still able to find seats and the service moved pretty quickly. I also ordered an iced chai and a chocolate chip cookie with nuts. The chai was fine, but not my favorite. However, everything else was absolutely great. I didn't eat the entire bowl there and then, but I ate it it the next day and it was still just as good.

For one drink, two bowls, and the cookie, we spent just over $50. But honestly, the bowls were pretty big and overall, I would say it was worth it.

It's a very cute café vibe. Cute and casual. You can roll in with sweatpants or a cute little dress and honestly fit right in. I can't wait to come back and try something else.",5,"Service: wonderful and super friendly, despite how busy it was and the line I was in to get food/drink!

Drinks: super delicious, and loved the ""spring specials"" (I got a matcha special). Although I didn't get food, I had no clue that they had so many gluten free options, so I will definitely be back when I'm in union market to try a snack or little meal!

Ambiance: so cute, and surprisingly, pretty spacious (although I've heard that space can be limited bc of how popular this place is).",5,"I love coming to maman. It's close to my neighborhood and has become one of my favorite coffee shops.

Fair warning that this place is ALWAYS packed, especially during the weekends. While there is an upstairs and downstairs, seats are first come first serve and definitely feels like the hunger games. The decor is adorable and has images of the founders and their grandkids sprinkled throughout.

I try to switch up what I order each time but I recently got mamas breakfast sandwich and it's delicious! The brioche bread with the caramelized onions absolutely does something to me. Honestly may be my favorite item on the menu thus far. Outside of their coffee options, they have a nice selection of teas.",5,"Let me start off with Brittany at the register this morning!

Maman is the perfect little spot to grab a coffee with a friend or quick sandwich for lunch. From the pastries to the drinks to the food, I haven't had anything bad from here.

The hot chocolate was a perfect accompaniment. Cinnamon and maybe magic are part of the cocoa recipe - it was delicious. As we left we noticed there's an outside patio too. Would definitely return.

I was walking by the Wharf enjoying the wonderful weekend and came across this location. I was able to go inside and place an order on the kiosk. If you sign up for alerts they give you a five-dollar discount which is great. You have a wide variety of options from sandwiches to empanadas. You can order a drink from the coffee bar or an alcohol beverage from the bar.

I ordered a Cuban sandwich with an iced Americano. They call your name for pick up and then you can sit either indoors or outdoors and enjoy your meal. The sandwich was packed with the right amount of meat and toppings. It is hard to find a good Cuban sandwich outside of Miami but this place does it well.
